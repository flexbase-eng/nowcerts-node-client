# nowcerts-node-client

`nowcerts-node-client` is a Node/JS and TypeScript Client for
[nowCerts](https://api.nowcerts.com/) that allows you to use normal Node
syntax to get, create and update insured/prospect and policies information
from nowCerts.

## Install

```bash
# with npm
$ npm install @flexbase/nowcerts-node-client
```

## Usage

This README isn't going to cover all the specifics of what now is,
and how to use it - it's targeted as a _companion_ to the nowCerts developer
[docs](https://api.nowcerts.com/)
that explain each of the endpoints and how the general nowCerts
[API](https://nowcerts.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000154522-nowcerts-com-rest-api) works.
